# ATM-Simulation-System
Menu-driven ATM Simulation System built using Core Python. Implements PIN authentication, balance enquiry, deposit, withdrawal, transaction history, and daily withdrawal limits.
🏦 ATM Simulation System – Core Python Mini Project
📌 Project Overview

The ATM Simulation System is a menu-driven Python program that simulates the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).
This project is developed using Core Python only, without any external libraries, and is intended to strengthen fundamental programming concepts.

🎯 Objectives

Practice core Python concepts

Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills

Understand real-world application flow using Python

Build confidence with functions, loops, and conditions

⚙️ Features
✅ Mandatory Features

PIN-based user authentication

Balance enquiry

Cash deposit

Cash withdrawal

⭐ Optional Features

Transaction history

Change PIN

Daily withdrawal limit

Exit option

🧠 Concepts Used

Variables and Data Types

Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)

Loops (while, for)

Functions

Lists

Input / Output operations

📋 How the Program Works

User logs in using a 4-digit PIN

On successful login, a menu is displayed

User selects operations like:

Check balance

Deposit money

Withdraw money

View transactions

Change PIN

All transactions are recorded

The program runs until the user chooses Exit

🧪 Sample Menu
--- ATM MENU ---
1. Balance Enquiry
2. Cash Deposit
3. Cash Withdrawal
4. Transaction History
5. Change PIN
6. Exit

▶️ How to Run the Project

Install Python 3

Clone this repository or download the file

Open terminal / command prompt

Run the program using:

python atm.py


Use the default PIN:

1234
